# ü¶úÔ∏è LangChain Java

‚ö° Building applications with LLMs through composability ‚ö°
 
 ## What is this?
 
This is the Java language implementation of LangChain.

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.

Looking for the Python version? Check out [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).
 
 ## Examples
Here's a simple example of using langchain-java to interact with OpenAI:
 
 ```java
    @Test
    void testOpenAICall() {
            OpenAI llm = OpenAI.builder()
            .openaiProxy(ProxyUtils.http("127.0.0.1", 1087))
            .maxTokens(10)
            .build()
            .init();

            assertThat(llm.call("Say foo:")).isEqualTo("\n\nFoo!");
            }
 ```
 
## Run Test from Source
Prerequisites for building:
* Git
* Java 17 or later
* Unix-like environment (we use Linux, Mac OS X)
* Maven (we recommend version 3.8.6 and require at least 3.5.4)

```
git clone https://github.com/HamaWhiteGG/langchain-java.git
cd langchain-java

# Set the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY, using the command 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx'

# export JAVA_HOME=JDK17_INSTALL_HOME && mvn clean test
mvn clean test
```
